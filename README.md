## Overview
Hi, in this project I have been working on various techniques of DLL injection. This project is a collection of my research and experiments with DLL injection.
This project includes a basic_dll(for testing purposes) and different methods for injection ->


>   1) CreateRemoteThread + LoadLibrary [simple method]
>   2) Manual Mapping
>   3) Thread Hijacking
>   4) APC Injection (Async Procedure Call)

## The End
Have fun stay safe, If you have further ideas or suggestions go on I am all ears.
